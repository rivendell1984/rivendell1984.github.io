In this policy, “CB” refers to Cowabunga Studios and its Affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership. We may also refer to CB as “We” or “Us”.</p>
<p>When you use an CB Service, you agree to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and restrictions in this Privacy Policy. Please read them carefully. Each of CB Services has its own specific Privacy Policy, and if you download, access, or use an CB Service, you agree to also be bound by its specific Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY CB SERVICE.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The personally identifiable information (“personal information”) and other information We collect and hold, how we do so and the purposes of our collection</li>

<li>How you can access and update such information</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The choices you can make about how We collect, use and share your information</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p>If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy or our collection and use of information, please contact us as described in the Section “Contact Us”.</p>

This information is typically collected through the use of server log files or web log files (“Log Files”), mobile device software development kits and tracking technologies like browser cookies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information. Some of the cookies the Service places on your computer are linked to your user ID number(s). For more information on how We utilize cookies and other tracking technologies, please review the “Cookies and Automated Information Collection” discussion under (“How We Collect Information about You”).</p>
<h2 id="HOW-WE-COLLECT-INFORMATION-ABOUT-YOU"><a href="#HOW-WE-COLLECT-INFORMATION-ABOUT-YOU" class="headerlink" title="HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU"></a>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h2><p>We may collect information about you in any one or more of the following ways:</p>
<h3 id="INFORMATION-ABOUT-PLAYERS-AND-PLAY"><a href="#INFORMATION-ABOUT-PLAYERS-AND-PLAY" class="headerlink" title="INFORMATION ABOUT PLAYERS AND PLAY"></a>INFORMATION ABOUT PLAYERS AND PLAY</h3><p>To provide a richer game play and social experience in our Services, We collect information about your play and interaction with other players and users. The bulk of this information is collected and stored through the use of Log Files, which are files on our web servers that record actions taken on our games and websites.</p>
<h3 id="COMMUNICATIONS-FEATURES"><a href="#COMMUNICATIONS-FEATURES" class="headerlink" title="COMMUNICATIONS FEATURES"></a>COMMUNICATIONS FEATURES</h3><p>You may be able to take part in certain activities on our websites or games that give you the opportunity to communicate or share information not just with CB, but also with other users of our Service.

</ul>
<p>We may record and store archives of these communications on CB’s servers to protect the safety and well-being of our users and CB’s rights and property in connection with the Services. You acknowledge and consent to the recording and storage of such communications for these purposes.</p>
<h2 id="COOKIES-AND-AUTOMATED-INFORMATION-COLLECTION"><a href="#COOKIES-AND-AUTOMATED-INFORMATION-COLLECTION" class="headerlink" title="COOKIES AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION COLLECTION"></a>COOKIES AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2><p>When you access the Services, We collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and Services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, may use Log Files and other tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information over time and across different websites following your use of the Service, including cookies, WiFi information, IP addresses, geo-location, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, Service state and the date and time of activity on our websites or Services, and other similar information. In some cases, We will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use. Our Service currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) settings in your web browser and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For further details regarding DNT, visit donottrack.us.</p>
<p>We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow Us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow Us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help Us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Service preferences and speed up load times.</p>
<p>You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of playing our Services, as CB cookies are necessary to track and enhance your Service activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our Services or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Service and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) allows for the central opting out of all its members’ cookies from a single opt-out page. If you prefer not to receive relevant advertising on web pages, please click on the following link: networkadvertising.org/choices/. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.</p>
<h2 id="OTHER-SOURCES"><a href="#OTHER-SOURCES" class="headerlink" title="OTHER SOURCES"></a>OTHER SOURCES</h2><p>We may collect or receive information from other sources including (i) other CB users who choose to upload their email contacts; and (ii) third party information providers. This information will be used to supplement your profile - primarily to help you and your friends connect. It will be combined with other information We collect.</p>
<h2 id="HOW-WE-USE-THE-INFORMATION-WE-COLLECT"><a href="#HOW-WE-USE-THE-INFORMATION-WE-COLLECT" class="headerlink" title="HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT"></a>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2><p>In general, We collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun, and customized experience.

<ul>
<li>To create your Service accounts and access to our Services</li>

<p>One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to CB, We’ll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your in-Service activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-Service status and requests. Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a Service, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional messages (“Promotional Communications”) directly or in partnership with parties other than CB. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients choices about receiving additional messages.</p>
<h2 id="SHARING-OF-YOUR-INFORMATION"><a href="#SHARING-OF-YOUR-INFORMATION" class="headerlink" title="SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION"></a>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p>We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, (i.e., parties other than CB), in the following circumstances:</p>
<h3 id="THIRD-PARTY-SERVICE-PROVIDERS"><a href="#THIRD-PARTY-SERVICE-PROVIDERS" class="headerlink" title="THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS"></a>THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3><p>We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service, placement of ads and assisting Us in other marketing efforts. We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on CB’s behalf.</p>
<h3 id="SAFETY-SECURITY-AND-COMPLIANCE-WITH-LAW"><a href="#SAFETY-SECURITY-AND-COMPLIANCE-WITH-LAW" class="headerlink" title="SAFETY, SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAW"></a>SAFETY, SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAW</h3><p>Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when We have a good faith belief that We are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations; (iii) where We believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when We have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of CB.</p>
<h3 id="YOUR-CALIFORNIA-PRIVACY-RIGHTS"><a href="#YOUR-CALIFORNIA-PRIVACY-RIGHTS" class="headerlink" title="YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS"></a>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3><p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.</p>
<p>Your access to the Services will not be affected if you do not “opt in” to receive information from such third parties.</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in email to: <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x77;&#98;&#101;&#101;&#49;&#57;&#56;&#52;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x6e;&#x65;&#x77;&#98;&#101;&#101;&#49;&#57;&#56;&#52;&#64;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>.</p>
<h3 id="SALE-OR-MERGER"><a href="#SALE-OR-MERGER" class="headerlink" title="SALE OR MERGER"></a>SALE OR MERGER</h3><p>In the event that CB undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, We may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition. If material changes to CB’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, We will notify you and other users (in the manner described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy below) of the business transition prior to transferring your personal information.</p>
<h3 id="OUR-POLICIES-CONCERNING-CHILDREN"><a href="#OUR-POLICIES-CONCERNING-CHILDREN" class="headerlink" title="OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN"></a>OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN</h3><p>Our Services (including websites, games, and applications) are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to register for or use the Services. Children under the age of 13 should not use our Services or send us any personal information about themselves at any time. In the event We learn that We have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, We will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records. If you believe that we might have information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.</p>
<h2 id="HOW-TO-ACCESS-AND-UPDATE-YOUR-INFORMATION"><a href="#HOW-TO-ACCESS-AND-UPDATE-YOUR-INFORMATION" class="headerlink" title="HOW TO ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION"></a>HOW TO ACCESS AND UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION</h2><h3 id="INFORMATION-WE-RECEIVE-FROM-AN-SNS-WHERE-YOU-ACCESS-OUR-SERVICES"><a href="#INFORMATION-WE-RECEIVE-FROM-AN-SNS-WHERE-YOU-ACCESS-OUR-SERVICES" class="headerlink" title="INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM AN SNS WHERE YOU ACCESS OUR SERVICES"></a>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM AN SNS WHERE YOU ACCESS OUR SERVICES</h3><p>To manage the information CB receives about you from an SNS where you play our Services, you will need to follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. The privacy management tools for applications on Apple can be found <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/manage-your-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. The privacy management tools for Google can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/safetycenter/everyone/start/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.

You can manage certain aspects of information collection and use by going to the settings of your (mobile) device and reviewing the permissions of each application.</p>
